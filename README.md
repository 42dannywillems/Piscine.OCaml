# Piscine.OCaml (OCaml pool)

## What's a "pool" in 42 ?

42 organizes some "pools" (Piscines). These "pools" are there to learn a new
language or a new paradigm in a very short period of time, from 2 weeks to 1
month.

There's a pool in C (a mandatory part to be authorized to go in 42), in C++, in
web (HTML/CSS, PHP, Javascript/Ajax/JQuery), in Unity3D and in OCaml.

During this period of time, we have, each day of the week, a list of exercices
to make for the next day. During the week-end, we have "rushes" or projects
consisting of a problem to solve and we have to make it for the next monday.

As usual in 42, we don't have courses but small videos to present concepts of
the day.

Pools are a good way to learn something because we have to learn fast each
concepts and we can't continue without understood the past exercices.
It's a very intensive pediod and we work around 8 hours a day (more for
sometimes, depending on our level and the pool).

**I can't diffuse the subjects**.

## What about the OCaml pool ?

This pool presents the functional paradigm with the OCaml language. It's in two
weeks and there's 2 rushes. We learn the basics of OCaml, compilation methods,
tail recursion, pattern matching, modules, advances types, variant types,
polymorphic types, functors, etc (not exhaustive).
We also learn the imperative and OOP parts of OCaml.

(description not exhaustive).
* [d00](https://github.com/42dannywillems/Piscine.OCaml.d00): basics type and functions.
* [d01](https://github.com/42dannywillems/Piscine.OCaml.d01): recursion, tail recursion
* [d02](https://github.com/42dannywillems/Piscine.OCaml.d02): pattern matching, records, variants, lists, parametric types, tuples.
* [d03](https://github.com/42dannywillems/Piscine.OCaml.d03): compilation, interpreter, link with external libraries, opam, binding to
  C libraries, file types.
* [d04](https://github.com/42dannywillems/Piscine.OCaml.d04): Module language.
* [d05](https://github.com/42dannywillems/Piscine.OCaml.d05): Imperative parts.
* [d06](https://github.com/42dannywillems/Piscine.OCaml.d06): functors.
* [d07](https://github.com/42dannywillems/Piscine.OCaml.d07): OOP (1/2)
* [d08](https://github.com/42dannywillems/Piscine.OCaml.d08): OOP (2/2)
* [d09](https://github.com/42dannywillems/Piscine.OCaml.d09): Monoids and monads.

We have also two rushes (after d04 and d09) and we manipulate graphics library
such as SDL and GTK.
